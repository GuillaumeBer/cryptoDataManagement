# Asset Mapping Usage

This document describes how the asset mapping table, generated by the `buildAssetMappings.ts` script, will be used within the application.

## Loading the Mapping Table

The `asset-mappings.json` file, located in `backend/data/`, will be loaded by a dedicated service, `AssetMappingLoader`, at the application startup. This service will parse the JSON file and store the mappings in memory for fast access.

The `AssetMappingLoader` service will expose a method to get the unified assets, for example `getUnifiedAssets()`, which will return the list of assets that are available on at least 3 platforms.

## API Endpoint

A new API endpoint, `/api/unified-assets`, will be created to expose the unified asset data to the frontend. This endpoint will use the `AssetMappingLoader` service to get the data and send it to the client.

The response of this endpoint will be an array of unified assets, each with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "canonical": "BTC",
    "platforms": {
      "binance": "BTCUSDT",
      "bybit": "BTCUSD",
      "hyperliquid": "BTC"
    }
  },
  {
    "canonical": "ETH",
    "platforms": {
      "binance": "ETHUSDT",
      "bybit": "ETHUSD",
      "hyperliquid": "ETH"
    }
  }
]
```

## Frontend Usage

The frontend will be updated to include a new "Asset-Centric View". This view will:

1.  Fetch the unified assets from the `/api/unified-assets` endpoint.
2.  Display a list of the unified assets, each with the list of platforms where it is available.
3.  Allow the user to select a unified asset and see a comparison of its data (e.g., funding rates, OHLCV) across the different platforms.

This new view will provide a powerful tool for cross-platform analysis, allowing users to easily compare the same asset on different exchanges.
